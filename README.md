printer-web-frontend
====================

Back in the Fall of 2010, Dawit Zewdie and I created a web frontend to submit
files (pdfs or Microsoft Word documents) to the server to print.  The server
will convert the files to pdfs and use lpr to print them on a printer
connected to the server.

The idea was to set up the printer in a public place in my dorm and have
people to able to print to it using a simple http upload instead of having to
set up their computers to print directly to network printers.  This was
analagous to quickprint.mit.edu
